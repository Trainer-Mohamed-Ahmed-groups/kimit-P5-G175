1- Your task is to create a function called calculateAverageGrades that takes the students array as an argument and transforms it into a new array with the following properties:

studentAverages: an array of objects where each key is a student's name, and the value is their average grade.

Your function should return the transformed array array of objects.
Hint ==> the new array of objects will contain objects like this for example: {name: "Alice", average: 80%}

initial array of objects:
var students = [
  { name: "Alice", grades: [90, 85, 88] },
  { name: "Bob", grades: [78, 92, 87] },
  { name: "Charlie", grades: [95, 89, 78] },
  { name: "David", grades: [88, 90, 92] }
];

2- Create a function that takes 2 parameters this array of object as parameter and status as the second parameter, this function will display another array of object "filteredBooks" depending on the status of the book (read or unread).

Example usage:
filterBooksByStatus(library, "unread");
filterBooksByStatus(library, "read");
filterBooksByStatus(library, "in-progress"); // This will log an empty array

initial array of objects:
const library = [
    {
        title: "The Hobbit",
        author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
        pages: 300,
        status: "unread"
    },
    {
        title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
        author: "Harper Lee",
        pages: 400,
        status: "read"
    },
    {
        title: "1984",
        author: "George Orwell",
        pages: 350,
        status: "unread"
    },
    {
        title: "1984eads",
        author: "Harper",
        pages: 350,
        status: "read"
    }
];

3- A word is on the loose and now has tried to hide amongst a crowd of tall letters! Help write a function to detect what the word is, knowing the following rules:

- The wanted word is in lowercase.
- The crowd of letters is all in uppercase.
- Note that the word will be spread out amongst the random letters, but their letters remain in the same order.
Hint ==> the input string will be something like this "SDNIDWDWDNDwordKJNJSDN".

4- Eligiblity for a discount => the "checkDiscountEligibility" function takes a person object with a name and age. The function uses an if condition to check if the person's age is between 18 and 30 (inclusive). If the condition is true, it prints a message indicating that the person is eligible for a discount; otherwise, it prints a message saying the person is not eligible.
